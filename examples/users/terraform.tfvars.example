#    export TF_VAR_umbrella_api_secret="your-secret"
#    export TF_VAR_umbrella_org_id="your-org-id"
#    export TF_VAR_admin_password="your-password"
# 3. Use a password manager to generate and store secure passwords
# 4. Implement regular password rotation policies
# 5. Enable two-factor authentication through the Umbrella console
